# ANNDL-homework
The python notebooks for the Artificial Neural Networks course challenges at Politecnico di Milano. 

The first is an image classification assignment and the second a time series prediction task. 

They are dealt with using tensorflow keras implementations of different Deep Learning models. 
In the first case we use Convolutional Neural Networks and in the second LSTMs. 

See reports for a more detailed summary of the approach utilized in dealin with the tasks.
